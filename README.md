Cricket Players Social Network Analysis using Gephi.pdf contains the fully accomplished step I did.

This workshop was a new experience for me and I gained more new things and I learned to improve myself more things.

I learned a new tool for Social Network Analysis.

The tool I learned newly is = **"Gephi"**.

By using this tool is learned to analyze the network of any person or the relationship of any person by considering many attributes.

Here we can upload the dataset or generate a dataset by randomly using the Gephi tool.

After uploading the dataset to the data laboratory we can see our Nodes and Edges.

In Nodes ID and label are listed we can modify or change the name of the labels if needed.

I modified my labels by replacing them with different cricket players' names.

In Edges Source and Target are listed.

Now we can start analyzing the Network by doing the analysis and we can see visualization of the players.

In the preview setting, I modified Nodes functions, Node Labels functions, edges, edge arrows, edge labels, etc.... to make my network analysis the best graph.

Finally, we can see the **overview of the Social Network Analysis of the cricket Players** using the Gephi Tool.
