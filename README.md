Cricket Players Social Network Analysis using Gephi.pdf contains the full accomplish step I done.

This workshop was new Experience for me and I gained more new things and I learned to improve myself more things.

I learned a new tool to do Social Network Analysis.

The tool I learned newly is = **"Gephi"**.

By using this tool is learned to analysis the network of any person or relationship of anyperson by considering many attributes.

Here we can upload the dataset or generate a dataset by randomly using Gephi tool.

After uploading dataset in data laboratory we can see our Nodes and Edges.

In Nodes ID and label are listed we can modify or change the name of the labels if we needed.

I modified my labels by replacing with different cricket players name.

In Edges Source and Target are listed.

Now we can start analysing the Network by doing the analysis and we can see visualization of the players.

In the preview setting, I modified Nodes functions, Node Labels functions, edges, edge arrows, edge labels, etc.. to make my network analysis the best graph.

Finally we can see the **overview of the Social Network Analysis of the cricket Players** using Gephi Tool.
